Registering a winch IRQ is racy, an interrupt may occur before the winch is

scheduled to be (or has already been) freed, causing a panic later in

drm/amdgpu: Fix buffer size in gfx_v9_4_3_init_ cp_compute_microcode() and rlc_microcode()

The function gfx_v9_4_3_init_microcode in gfx_v9_4_3.c was generating
about potential truncation of output when using the snprintf function.
The issue was due to the size of the buffer 'ucode_prefix' being too
small to accommodate the maximum possible length of the string being
written into it.

The string being written is ""amdgpu/%s_mec.bin"" or ""amdgpu/%s_rlc.bin"",
where %s is replaced by the value of 'chip_name'. The length of this
string without the %s is 16 characters. The warning message indicated
that 'chip_name' could be up to 29 characters long, resulting in a total
of 45 characters, which exceeds the buffer size of 30 characters.

To resolve this issue, the size of the 'ucode_prefix' buffer has been
reduced from 30 to 15. This ensures that the maximum possible length of
the string being written into the buffer will not exceed its size, thus
preventing potential buffer overflow and truncation issues.

Fixes the below with gcc W=1:

However that fix was not propagated to the secondary harts. The problem

fpga: region: add owner module and take its refcount

The current implementation of the fpga region assumes that the low-level
module registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer
to take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can
lead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the region
during programming if the parent device does not have a driver.

To address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_region
struct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the functions for
registering a region to take an additional owner module parameter and
rename them to avoid conflicts. Use the old function names for helper
macros that automatically set the module that registers the region as the
owner. This ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules
and reduces the chances of registering a region without setting the owner.

Also, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface
for registering an fpga region.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2279c09c36165ccded4d506d11a7714e13b56019"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/26e6e25d742e29885cf44274fcf6b744366c4702"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4d7d12b643c00e7eea51b49a60a2ead182633ec8"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/75a001914a8d2ccdcbe4b8cc7e94ac71d0e66093"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9b4eee8572dcf82b2ed17d9a328c7fb87df2f0e8"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b7c0e1ecee403a43abc89eb3e75672b01ff2ece9"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

f2fs: compress: don't allow unaligned truncation on released compress inode

f2fs image may be corrupted after below testcase:

- touch /mnt/f2fs/file
- f2fs_io setflags compression /mnt/f2fs/file

The reason is: partial truncation assume compressed inode has reserved
