so that we can check that we're not trying to reuse a chip\nselect that's already controlled.  This means that if the SPI device is\nitself a SPI controller and triggers the instantiation of further SPI\ndevices we trigger a deadlock as we try to register and instantiate\nthose devices while in the process of doing so for the parent controller\nand hence already holding the global spi_add_lock.
