However these pages are\nbeyond i_size, thus writeback code generally ignores these dirty pages\nand no blocks were ever actually zeroed on the disk.\n\nThis oversight was fixed by commit 693c241a5f6a (\"ocfs2: No need to zero\npages past i_size.\") for standard ocfs2 write path, inline conversion\npath was apparently forgotten; the commit log also has a reasoning why\nthe zeroing actually is not needed.\n\nAfter commit 6dbf7bb55598, things became worse as writeback code stopped\ninvalidating buffers on pages beyond i_size and thus these pages end up\nwith clean PageDirty bit but with buffers attached to these pages being\nstill dirty.  So when a file is converted from inline format, then\nwriteback triggers, and then the file is grown so that these pages\nbecome valid, the invalid dirtiness state is preserved,\nmark_buffer_dirty() does nothing on these pages (buffers are already\ndirty) but page is never written back because it is clean.  So data\nwritten to these pages is lost once pages are reclaimed.\n\nSimple reproducer for the problem is:\n\n  xfs_io -f -c \"pwrite 0 2000\" -c \"pwrite 2000 2000\" -c \"fsync\" \\\n    -c \"pwrite 4000 2000\" ocfs2_file\n\nAfter unmounting and mounting the fs again, you can observe that end of\n'ocfs2_file' has lost its contents.\n\nFix the problem by not doing the pointless zeroing during conversion\nfrom inline format similarly as in the standard write path.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: fix whitespace, per Joseph]\t0.00\t\t0.00\t\t[]\t[]\t[{\"url\": \"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5314454ea3ff6fc746eaf71b9a7ceebed52888fa\", \"source\": \"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67\"}, {\"url\": \"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/560edd14de2bf9dbc0129681eeb4d5ef87cc105f\", \"source\": \"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67\"}, {\"url\": \"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8e6bfb4f70168ddfd32fb6dc028ad52faaf1f32e\", \"source\": \"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67\"}, {\"url\": \"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a3a089c241cd49b33a8cdd7fcb37cc87a086912a\", \"source\": \"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67\"}, {\"url\": \"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b05caf023b14cbed9223bb5b48ecc7bffe38f632\", \"source\": \"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67\"}, {\"url\": \"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f1b98569e81c37d7e0deada7172f8f60860c1360\", \"source\": \"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67\"}, {\"url\": \"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fa9b6b6c953e3f6441ed6cf83b4c771dac2dae08\", \"source\": \"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67\"}]\tTrue\n506361\tCVE-2021-47461\t416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67\t2024-05-22 08:15:11.04+01\t2024-05-22 13:46:53.887+01\tAwaiting Analysis\tIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nuserfaultfd: fix a race between writeprotect and exit_mmap()\n\nA race is possible when a process exits, its VMAs are removed by\nexit_mmap() and at the same time userfaultfd_writeprotect() is called.\n\nThe race was detected by KASAN on a development kernel, but it appears\nto be possible on vanilla kernels as well.\n\nUse mmget_not_zero() to prevent the race as done in other userfaultfd\noperations.\t0.00\t\t0.00\t\t[]\t[]\t[{\"url\":\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LINUX KERNEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Linux kernel is the core component of a Linux operating system, responsible for managing system resources and hardware interactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCFS2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OCFS2 is a distributed file system for Linux that allows multiple nodes to share access to a single file system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CVE-2021-47461<|>EVENT<|>CVE-2021-47461 is a specific vulnerability identified in the Linux kernel related to a race condition in userfaultfd operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AKPM<|>PERSON<|>AKPM is a contributor to the Linux kernel, involved in fixing issues and improving the codebase.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX KERNEL<|>OCFS2<|>OCFS2 is a file system that operates within the Linux kernel, utilizing its features for managing file data.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX KERNEL<|>CVE-2021-47461<|>CVE-2021-47461 is a vulnerability that affects the Linux kernel, highlighting a specific issue within its code.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AKPM<|>LINUX KERNEL<|>AKPM is a contributor to the Linux kernel, working on fixes and improvements to its codebase.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AKPM<|>CVE-2021-47461<|>AKPM is involved in addressing the CVE-2021-47461 vulnerability in the Linux kernel.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
