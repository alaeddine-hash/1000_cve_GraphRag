cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/type\n mlxsw_fan\n # cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/max_state\n 10\n # echo 18 > /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/cur_state\n # echo $?\n 0\n\nThis results in out-of-bounds memory accesses when thermal state\ntransition statistics are enabled (CONFIG_THERMAL_STATISTICS=y), as the\ntransition table is accessed with a too large index (state) [1].\n\nAccording to the thermal maintainer, it is the responsibility of the\ndriver to reject such operations [2].\n\nTherefore, return an error when the state to be set exceeds the maximum\ncooling state supported by the driver.\n\nTo avoid dead code, as suggested by the thermal maintainer [3],\npartially revert commit a421ce088ac8 (\"mlxsw: core: Extend cooling\ndevice with cooling levels\") that tried to interpret these invalid\ncooling states (above the maximum) in a special way. The cooling levels\narray is not removed in order to prevent the fans going below 20% PWM,\nwhich would cause them to get stuck at 0% PWM.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in thermal_cooling_device_stats_update+0x271/0x290\nRead of size 4 at addr ffff8881052f7bf8 by task kworker/0:0/5\n\nCPU: 0 PID: 5 Comm: kworker/0:0 Not tainted 5.15.0-rc3-custom-45935-gce1adf704b14 #122\nHardware name: Mellanox Technologies Ltd. \"MSN2410-CB2FO\"/\"SA000874\", BIOS 4.6.5 03/08/2016\nWorkqueue: events_freezable_power_ thermal_zone_device_check\nCall Trace:\n dump_stack_lvl+0x8b/0xb3\n print_address_description.constprop.0+0x1f/0x140\n kasan_report.cold+0x7f/0x11b\n thermal_cooling_device_stats_update+0x271/0x290\n __thermal_cdev_update+0x15e/0x4e0\n thermal_cdev_update+0x9f/0xe0\n step_wise_throttle+0x770/0xee0\n thermal_zone_device_update+0x3f6/0xdf0\n process_one_work+0xa42/0x1770\n worker_thread+0x62f/0x13e0\n kthread+0x3ee/0x4e0\n ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n\nAllocated by task 1:\n kasan_save_stack+0x1b/0x40\n __kasan_kmalloc+0x7c/0x90\n thermal_cooling_device_setup_sysfs+0x153/0x2c0\n __thermal_cooling_device_register.part.0+0x25b/0x9c0\n thermal_cooling_device_register+0xb3/0x100\n mlxsw_thermal_init+0x5c5/0x7e0\n __mlxsw_core_bus_device_register+0\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LINUX KERNEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Linux kernel is the core component of a Linux operating system, managing hardware and system resources and providing essential services for all other parts of the operating system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MELLANOX TECHNOLOGIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mellanox Technologies is a company that produces high-performance interconnect solutions for data centers, including network adapters and switches.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CVE-2021-47441<|>EVENT<|>CVE-2021-47441 is a specific vulnerability identified in the Linux kernel related to out-of-bounds memory accesses in the mlxsw thermal driver.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THERMAL MAINTAINER<|>PERSON<|>The thermal maintainer is responsible for overseeing the thermal management subsystem in the Linux kernel, ensuring that drivers operate correctly and efficiently.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THERMAL COOLING DEVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A thermal cooling device is a component that manages the temperature of hardware by controlling cooling states, such as fans, in a computing environment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KASAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer) is a memory error detector for the Linux kernel that helps identify out-of-bounds accesses and use-after-free bugs.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CVE-2021-47441<|>LINUX KERNEL<|>CVE-2021-47441 is a vulnerability that affects the Linux kernel, specifically in the mlxsw thermal driver<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MELLANOX TECHNOLOGIES<|>LINUX KERNEL<|>Mellanox Technologies produces hardware that interacts with the Linux kernel, particularly in the context of thermal management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THERMAL MAINTAINER<|>LINUX KERNEL<|>The thermal maintainer oversees the thermal management subsystem within the Linux kernel<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THERMAL COOLING DEVICE<|>LINUX KERNEL<|>The thermal cooling device is managed by the Linux kernel to ensure proper temperature regulation<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KASAN<|>LINUX KERNEL<|>KASAN is a tool used within the Linux kernel to detect memory errors, including those related to vulnerabilities like CVE-2021-47441<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
