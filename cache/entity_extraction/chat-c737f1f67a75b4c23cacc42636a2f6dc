kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: fix locking for Tx timestamp tracking flush\n\nCommit 4dd0d5c33c3e (\"ice: add lock around Tx timestamp tracker flush\")\nadded a lock around the Tx timestamp tracker flow which is used to\ncleanup any left over SKBs and prepare for device removal.\n\nThis lock is problematic because it is being held around a call to\nice_clear_phy_tstamp. The clear function takes a mutex to send a PHY\nwrite command to firmware. This could lead to a deadlock if the mutex\nactually sleeps, and causes the following warning on a kernel with\npreemption debugging enabled:\n\n[  715.419426] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:573\n[  715.427900] in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 3100, name: rmmod\n[  715.435652] INFO: lockdep is turned off.\n[  715.439591] Preemption disabled at:\n[  715.439594] [<0000000000000000>] 0x0\n[  715.446678] CPU: 52 PID: 3100 Comm: rmmod Tainted: G        W  OE     5.15.0-rc4+ #42 bdd7ec3018e725f159ca0d372ce8c2c0e784891c\n[  715.458058] Hardware name: Intel Corporation S2600STQ/S2600STQ, BIOS SE5C620.86B.02.01.0010.010620200716 01/06/2020\n[  715.468483] Call Trace:\n[  715.470940]  dump_stack_lvl+0x6a/0x9a\n[  715.474613]  ___might_sleep.cold+0x224/0x26a\n[  715.478895]  __mutex_lock+0xb3/0x1440\n[  715.482569]  ? stack_depot_save+0x378/0x500\n[  715.486763]  ? ice_sq_send_cmd+0x78/0x14c0 [ice 9a7e1ec00971c89ecd3fe0d4dc7da2b3786a421d]\n[  715.494979]  ? kfree+0xc1/0x520\n[  715.498128]  ? mutex_lock_io_nested+0x12a0/0x12a0\n[  715.502837]  ? kasan_set_free_info+0x20/0x30\n[  715.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
