CVSS v3.1 Overview:
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an industry-standard method for evaluating the severity of security vulnerabilities. It assigns a numerical score based on three primary metric groups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. Each score reflects various characteristics of the vulnerability and helps prioritize security responses.

1. Base Metrics:
These metrics capture the fundamental attributes of a vulnerability that remain constant over time.

Attack Vector (AV): Describes how the vulnerability can be exploited:

Network (N): Accessible remotely.
Adjacent (A): Requires proximity (e.g., same network).
Local (L): Requires physical access.
Physical (P): Requires direct physical access to the system.
Attack Complexity (AC): Measures how easy it is to exploit:

Low (L): Simple to exploit.
High (H): Requires special conditions.
Privileges Required (PR): Describes the privileges an attacker needs:

None (N): No privileges required.
Low (L): Basic privileges needed.
High (H): Admin-level access required.
User Interaction (UI): Indicates whether the attack requires user interaction:

None (N): No interaction needed.
Required (R): Requires user input.
Scope (S): Measures if exploitation affects other systems or components:

Unchanged (U): Impact remains within the original system.
Changed (C): Affects other components or systems.
Impact Metrics: Reflect the severity of impacts on Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A):

None (N): No impact.
Low (L): Limited impact.
High (H): Significant impact.
2. Temporal Metrics:
These metrics account for characteristics that change over time, such as the availability of exploits and remediation.

Exploitability (E): The availability and maturity of exploit code.

Unproven (U) to High (H).
Remediation Level (RL): Indicates the availability of a fix.

Official Fix (O) to Unavailable (U).
Report Confidence (RC): How well the vulnerability is understood.

Unknown (U) to Confirmed (C).
3. Environmental Metrics:
These metrics are customized to reflect the specific context of the organization affected by the vulnerability.

Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Requirements: Organizations assign a priority level to each metric:
Low (L), Medium (M), High (H) importance.
CVSS Vector Example:
For a vector like CVSS:3.1/AV
/AC
/PR
/UI
/S
/C
/I
/A
, here’s how the vulnerability is described:

AV:N: Exploitable over the network.
AC:L: Low complexity, easy to exploit.
PR:L: Low-level privileges required.
UI:N: No user interaction needed.
S:C: Scope is changed, impacting other systems.
C:L: Low confidentiality impact.
I:N: No integrity impact.
A:N: No availability impact.
How CVSS Scores Are Calculated:

Base Score=min(Impact+Exploitability,10)

Why CVSS is Important:
Prioritization: Helps organizations prioritize vulnerabilities by severity.
Mitigation Planning: Guides decisions on which vulnerabilities to address first.
Tailored Assessment: The Environmental metrics enable organizations to customize scoring based on their specific security requirements.
Where to Find CVSS Metrics and Tools:
Official Documentation: The CVSS v3.1 Specification Document provides all metric values and examples.
CVSS Calculators: Tools like the NVD CVSS Calculator simplify score calculation.
Conclusion:
Using CVSS v3.1 allows organizations to assess vulnerabilities in a consistent and systematic way, helping to reduce security risks effectively. It is an invaluable tool for vulnerability management, enabling teams to make informed decisions on patching and other security controls.
