Error injection testing uncovered a case where we'd end up with a

occurs because the if statement to decide if we should abort is wrong.

The only way we would abort in this case is if we got a ret !=
-EOPNOTSUPP and we called from the file clone code.  However the
prealloc code uses this path too.  Instead we need to abort if there is
an error, and the only error we _don't_ abort on is -EOPNOTSUPP and only

xhci: Fix command ring pointer corruption while aborting a command

The command ring pointer is located at [6:63] bits of the command
ring control register (CRCR). All the control bits like command stop,
abort are located at [0:3] bits. While aborting a command, we read the
CRCR and set the abort bit and write to the CRCR. The read will always
give command ring pointer as all zeros. So we essentially write only
the control bits. Since we split the 64 bit write into two 32 bit writes,
there is a possibility of xHC command ring stopped before the upper
dword (all zeros) is written. If that happens, xHC updates the upper
dword of its internal command ring pointer with all zeros. Next time,
when the command ring is restarted, we see xHC memory access failures.
Fix this issue by only writing to the lower dword of CRCR where all
control bits are located.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/01c2dcb67e71c351006dd17cbba86c26b7f61eaf"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/22bcb65ea41072ab5d03c0c6290e04e0df6d09a0"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/62c182b5e763e5f4062e72678e72ce3e02dd4d1b"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dec944bb7079b37968cf69c8a438f91f15c4cc61"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e54abefe703ab7c4e5983e889babd1447738ca42"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ff0e50d3564f33b7f4b35cadeabd951d66cfc570"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",True

usb: musb: dsps: Fix the probe error path

Commit 7c75bde329d7 (""usb: musb: musb_dsps: request_irq() after
initializing musb"") has inverted the calls to
dsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() and dsps_create_musb_pdev() without
updating correctly the error path. dsps_create_musb_pdev() allocates and
registers a new platform device which must be unregistered and freed
with platform_device_unregister(), and this is missing upon
dsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() error.

While on the master branch it seems not to trigger any issue, I observed
a kernel crash because of a NULL pointer dereference with a v5.10.70
stable kernel where the patch mentioned above was backported. With this
kernel version, -EPROBE_DEFER is returned the first time
dsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() is called which triggers the probe to
error out without unregistering the platform device. Unfortunately, on
the Beagle Bone Black Wireless, the platform device still living in the
system is being used by the USB Ethernet gadget driver, which during the
boot phase triggers the crash.

My limited knowledge of the musb world prevents me to revert this commit
which was sent to silence a robot warning which, as far as I understand,
does not make sense. The goal of this patch was to prevent an IRQ to
fire before the platform device being registered. I think this cannot
ever happen due to the fact that enabling the interrupts is done by the
->enable() callback of the platform musb device, and this platform
device must be already registered in order for the core or any other

net/mlx5e: Fix memory leak in mlx5_core_destroy_cq() error path

Prior to this patch in case mlx5_core_destroy_cq() failed it returns
without completing all destroy operations and that leads to memory leak.
Instead, complete the destroy flow before return error.

Also move mlx5_debug_cq_remove() to the beginning of mlx5_core_destroy_cq()
to be symmetrical with mlx5_core_create_cq().

net: dsa: microchip: Added the condition for scheduling ksz_mib_read_work

When the ksz module is installed and removed using rmmod, kernel crashes
with null pointer dereferrence error. During rmmod, ksz_switch_remove
function tries to cancel the mib_read_workqueue using
cancel_delayed_work_sync routine and unregister switch from dsa.

During dsa_unregister_switch it calls ksz_mac_link_down, which in turn
reschedules the workqueue since mib_interval is non-zero.
Due to which queue executed after mib_interval and it tries to access
dp->slave. But the slave is unregistered in the ksz_switch_remove
function. Hence kernel crashes.

To avoid this crash, before canceling the workqueue, resetted the
mib_interval to 0.

mlxsw: thermal: Fix out-of-bounds memory accesses

Currently, mlxsw allows cooling states to be set above the maximum
cooling state supported by the driver:

 # cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/type
 mlxsw_fan
 # cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/max_state
 10
 # echo 18 > /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/cur_state
 # echo $?
 0

This results in out-of-bounds memory accesses when thermal state
transition statistics are enabled (CONFIG_THERMAL_STATISTICS=y), as the
transition table is accessed with a too large index (state) [1].

According to the thermal maintainer, it is the responsibility of the
driver to reject such operations [2].

Therefore, return an error when the state to be set exceeds the maximum
cooling state supported by the driver.

To avoid dead code, as suggested by the thermal maintainer [3],
partially revert commit a421ce088ac8 (""mlxsw: core: Extend cooling
device with cooling levels"") that tried to interpret these invalid
cooling states (above the maximum) in a special way. The cooling levels
array is not removed in order to prevent the fans going below 20% PWM,
which would cause them to get stuck at 0% PWM.

drm/edid: In connector_bad_edid() cap num_of_ext by num_blocks read

In commit e11f5bd8228f (""drm: Add support for DP 1.4 Compliance edid
corruption test"") the function connector_bad_edid() started assuming
that the memory for the EDID passed to it was big enough to hold
`edid[0x7e] + 1` blocks of data (1 extra for the base block). It
completely ignored the fact that the function was passed `num_blocks`
which indicated how much memory had been allocated for the EDID.

Let's fix this by adding a bounds check.

This is important for handling the case where there's an error in the
first block of the EDID. In that case we will call
connector_bad_edid() without having re-allocated memory based on
`edid[0x7e]`.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/09f3946bb452918dbfb1982add56f9ffaae393dc"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/97794170b696856483f74b47bfb6049780d2d3a0"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a7b45024f66f9ec769e8dbb1a51ae83cd05929c7"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",True

recvmsg() can enter an infinite loop if the caller provides the

ice: fix locking for Tx timestamp tracking flush

Commit 4dd0d5c33c3e (""ice: add lock around Tx timestamp tracker flush"")
added a lock around the Tx timestamp tracker flow which is used to
cleanup any left over SKBs and prepare for device removal.

This lock is problematic because it is being held around a call to
ice_clear_phy_tstamp. The clear function takes a mutex to send a PHY
write command to firmware. This could lead to a deadlock if the mutex
actually sleeps, and causes the following warning on a kernel with
preemption debugging enabled:

KVM: arm64: Fix host stage-2 PGD refcount

The KVM page-table library refcounts the pages of concatenated stage-2
PGDs individually. However, when running KVM in protected mode, the
host's stage-2 PGD is currently managed by EL2 as a single high-order
compound page, which can cause the refcount of the tail pages to reach 0
when they shouldn't, hence corrupting the page-table.

Fix this by introducing a new hyp_split_page() helper in the EL2 page
allocator (matching the kernel's split_page() function), and make use of
it from host_s2_zalloc_pages_exact().","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1d58a17ef54599506d44c45ac95be27273a4d2b1"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b372264c66ef78f2cab44e877fbd765ad6d24c39"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",True

netfilter: xt_IDLETIMER: fix panic that occurs when timer_type has garbage value

Currently, when the rule related to IDLETIMER is added, idletimer_tg timer
structure is initialized by kmalloc on executing idletimer_tg_create
function. However, in this process timer->timer_type is not defined to
a specific value. Thus, timer->timer_type has garbage value and it occurs
kernel panic. So, this commit fixes the panic by initializing
timer->timer_type using kzalloc instead of kmalloc.

Test commands:
    # iptables -A OUTPUT -j IDLETIMER --timeout 1 --label test
    $ cat /sys/class/xt_idletimer/timers/test

Problem is that when netns device exit hooks create the UNREGISTER

base hook.  Notifier attempts to do this again.

The need to do base hook unregister unconditionally was needed in the past,
because notifier was last stage where reg->dev dereference was safe.

Now that nf_tables does the hook removal in .pre_exit, this isn't
needed anymore.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/68a3765c659f809dcaac20030853a054646eb739"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/90c7c58aa2bd02c65a4c63b7dfe0b16eab12cf9f"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",True

ice: Avoid crash from unnecessary IDA free

In the remove path, there is an attempt to free the aux_idx IDA whether
it was allocated or not.  This can potentially cause a crash when
unloading the driver on systems that do not initialize support for RDMA.
But, this free cannot be gated by the status bit for RDMA, since it is
allocated if the driver detects support for RDMA at probe time, but the
driver can enter into a state where RDMA is not supported after the IDA
has been allocated at probe time and this would lead to a memory leak.

This is because powerpc's arch_cpu_idle_dead() decrements the idle task's

expects a preempt_count() of 0.""

However, since commit 2c669ef6979c (""powerpc/preempt: Don't touch the idle
task's preempt_count during hotplug"") and commit f1a0a376ca0c (""sched/core:
Initialize the idle task with preemption disabled""), that justification no
longer holds.

The idle task isn't supposed to re-enable preemption, so remove the

ocfs2: mount fails with buffer overflow in strlen

Starting with kernel 5.11 built with CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE mouting an
ocfs2 filesystem with either o2cb or pcmk cluster stack fails with the
trace below.  Problem seems to be that strings for cluster stack and
cluster name are not guaranteed to be null terminated in the disk
representation, while strlcpy assumes that the source string is always
null terminated.  This causes a read outside of the source string
triggering the buffer overflow detection.

ocfs2: fix data corruption after conversion from inline format

Commit 6dbf7bb55598 (""fs: Don't invalidate page buffers in
block_write_full_page()"") uncovered a latent bug in ocfs2 conversion
from inline inode format to a normal inode format.

The code in ocfs2_convert_inline_data_to_extents() attempts to zero out
the whole cluster allocated for file data by grabbing, zeroing, and
dirtying all pages covering this cluster.  However these pages are
beyond i_size, thus writeback code generally ignores these dirty pages
and no blocks were ever actually zeroed on the disk.

This oversight was fixed by commit 693c241a5f6a (""ocfs2: No need to zero
pages past i_size."") for standard ocfs2 write path, inline conversion
path was apparently forgotten; the commit log also has a reasoning why
the zeroing actually is not needed.

After commit 6dbf7bb55598, things became worse as writeback code stopped
invalidating buffers on pages beyond i_size and thus these pages end up
with clean PageDirty bit but with buffers attached to these pages being
still dirty.  So when a file is converted from inline format, then
writeback triggers, and then the file is grown so that these pages
become valid, the invalid dirtiness state is preserved,
mark_buffer_dirty() does nothing on these pages (buffers are already
dirty) but page is never written back because it is clean.  So data
written to these pages is lost once pages are reclaimed.

Simple reproducer for the problem is:

  xfs_io -f -c ""pwrite 0 2000"" -c ""pwrite 2000 2000"" -c ""fsync"" \
    -c ""pwrite 4000 2000"" ocfs2_file

After unmounting and mounting the fs again, you can observe that end of
'ocfs2_file' has lost its contents.

Fix the problem by not doing the pointless zeroing during conversion
from inline format similarly as in the standard write path.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix stack handling in idle_kvm_start_guest()

In commit 10d91611f426 (""powerpc/64s: Reimplement book3s idle code in
C"") kvm_start_guest() became idle_kvm_start_guest(). The old code
allocated a stack frame on the emergency stack, but didn't use the
frame to store anything, and also didn't store anything in its caller's
frame.

idle_kvm_start_guest() on the other hand is written more like a normal C
function, it creates a frame on entry, and also stores CR/LR into its
callers frame (per the ABI). The problem is that there is no caller
frame on the emergency stack.

The emergency stack for a given CPU is allocated with:

  paca_ptrs[i]->emergency_sp = alloc_stack(limit, i) + THREAD_SIZE;

So emergency_sp actually points to the first address above the emergency
stack allocation for a given CPU, we must not store above it without
first decrementing it to create a frame. This is different to the
regular kernel stack, paca->kstack, which is initialised to point at an
initial frame that is ready to use.

idle_kvm_start_guest() stores the backchain, CR and LR all of which
write outside the allocation for the emergency stack. It then creates a
stack frame and saves the non-volatile registers. Unfortunately the
frame it creates is not large enough to fit the non-volatiles, and so
the saving of the non-volatile registers also writes outside the
emergency stack allocation.

The end result is that we corrupt whatever is at 0-24 bytes, and 112-248
bytes above the emergency stack allocation.

In practice this has gone unnoticed because the memory immediately above
the emergency stack happens to be used for other stack allocations,
either another CPUs mc_emergency_sp or an IRQ stack. See the order of
calls to irqstack_early_init() and emergency_stack_init().

The low addresses of another stack are the top of that stack, and so are
only used if that stack is under extreme pressue, which essentially
never happens in practice - and if it did there's a high likelyhood we'd
crash due to that stack overflowing.

Still, we shouldn't be corrupting someone else's stack, and it is purely
luck that we aren't corrupting something else.

To fix it we save CR/LR into the caller's frame using the existing r1 on
entry, we then create a SWITCH_FRAME_SIZE frame (which has space for
pt_regs) on the emergency stack with the backchain pointing to the
existing stack, and then finally we switch to the new frame on the
emergency stack.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6d077c37c4643394b1bae9682da48164fc147ea8"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/80bbb0bc3a0288442f7fe6fc514f4ee1cb06ccb7"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9b4416c5095c20e110c82ae602c254099b83b72f"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fbd724c49bead048ae9fc1a5b7bff2fb3e54f855"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",True

comedi: vmk80xx: fix transfer-buffer overflows

The driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but up until
recently had no sanity checks on the sizes.

Commit e1f13c879a7c (""staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSize
of usb endpoints found"") inadvertently fixed NULL-pointer dereferences
when accessing the transfer buffers in case a malicious device has a
zero wMaxPacketSize.

Make sure to allocate buffers large enough to handle also the other
accesses that are done without a size check (e.g. byte 18 in
vmk80xx_cnt_insn_read() for the VMK8061_MODEL) to avoid writing beyond
the buffers, for example, when doing descriptor fuzzing.

It's easy to see from crash log, that driver accesses released firmware
in ->ndo_open() callback. It may happen, since driver was releasing
firmware _before_ unregistering netdev. Fix it by moving
unregister_netdev() before cleaning up resources.

net: batman-adv: fix error handling

Syzbot reported ODEBUG warning in batadv_nc_mesh_free(). The problem was
in wrong error handling in batadv_mesh_init().

Before this patch batadv_mesh_init() was calling batadv_mesh_free() in case
of any batadv_*_init() calls failure. This approach may work well, when
there is some kind of indicator, which can tell which parts of batadv are
initialized; but there isn't any.

All written above lead to cleaning up uninitialized fields. Even if we hide
ODEBUG warning by initializing bat_priv->nc.work, syzbot was able to hit
GPF in batadv_nc_purge_paths(), because hash pointer in still NULL. [1]

To fix these bugs we can unwind batadv_*_init() calls one by one.
It is good approach for 2 reasons: 1) It fixes bugs on error handling
path 2) It improves the performance, since we won't call unneeded
batadv_*_free() functions.

So, this patch makes all batadv_*_init() clean up all allocated memory
before returning with an error to no call correspoing batadv_*_free()
and open-codes batadv_mesh_free() with proper order to avoid touching
uninitialized fields.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/07533f1a673ce1126d0a72ef1e4b5eaaa3dd6d20"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0c6b199f09be489c48622537a550787fc80aea73"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6422e8471890273994fe8cc6d452b0dcd2c9483e"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6f68cd634856f8ca93bafd623ba5357e0f648c68"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a8f7359259dd5923adc6129284fdad12fc5db347"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b0a2cd38553c77928ef1646ed1518486b1e70ae8"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e50f957652190b5a88a8ebce7e5ab14ebd0d3f00"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fbf150b16a3635634b7dfb7f229d8fcd643c6c51"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",True

This is because that since the commit 2b0d3d3e4fcf (""percpu_ref: reduce
memory footprint of percpu_ref in fast path"") root_cgrp->bpf.refcnt.data
is allocated by the function percpu_ref_init in cgroup_bpf_inherit which
is called by cgroup_setup_root when mounting, but not freed along with
root_cgrp when umounting. Adding cgroup_bpf_offline which calls
percpu_ref_kill to cgroup_kill_sb can free root_cgrp->bpf.refcnt.data in
umount path.

This patch also fixes the commit 4bfc0bb2c60e (""bpf: decouple the lifetime
of cgroup_bpf from cgroup itself""). A cgroup_bpf_offline is needed to do a
cleanup that frees the resources which are allocated by cgroup_bpf_inherit
in cgroup_setup_root.

And inside cgroup_bpf_offline, cgroup_get() is at the beginning and
cgroup_put is at the end of cgroup_bpf_release which is called by
cgroup_bpf_offline. So cgroup_bpf_offline can keep the balance of
cgroup's refcount.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/01599bf7cc2b49c3d2be886cb438647dc25446ed"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04f8ef5643bcd8bcde25dfdebef998aea480b2ba"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b529f88d93884cf8ccafda793ee3d27b82fa578d"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",True

The read-only THP for filesystems will collapse THP for files opened

misses for large text segments.  But it doesn't restrict the file types
so a THP could be collapsed for a non-regular file, for example, block
device, if it is opened readonly and mapped with EXEC permission.  This
may cause bugs, like [1] and [2].

This is definitely not the intended usecase, so just collapse THP for

The management registrations locking was broken, the list was
locked for each wdev, but cfg80211_mgmt_registrations_update()
iterated it without holding all the correct spinlocks, causing
list corruption.

Rather than trying to fix it with fine-grained locking, just
move the lock to the wiphy/rdev (still need the list on each
wdev), we already need to hold the wdev lock to change it, so
there's no contention on the lock in any case. This trivially
fixes the bug since we hold one wdev's lock already, and now
will hold the lock that protects all lists.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/09b1d5dc6ce1c9151777f6c4e128a59457704c97"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3c897f39b71fe68f90599f6a45b5f7bf5618420e"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4c22227e39c7a0b4dab55617ee8d34d171fab8d4"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",True

net/tls: Fix flipped sign in tls_err_abort() calls

sk->sk_err appears to expect a positive value, a convention that ktls

For instance,

If a cell has 'nbits' equal to a multiple of BITS_PER_BYTE the logic

will become undefined behavior because nbits modulo BITS_PER_BYTE is 0, and we
subtract one from that making a large number that is then shifted more than the
number of bits that fit into an unsigned long.

Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix slab-use-after-free in l2cap_connect()

Extend a critical section to prevent chan from early freeing.
Also make the l2cap_connect() return type void. Nothing is using the
returned value but it is ugly to return a potentially freed pointer.
Making it void will help with backports because earlier kernels did use
the return value. Now the compile will break for kernels where this
patch is not a complete fix.

aio: fix use-after-free due to missing POLLFREE handling

signalfd_poll() and binder_poll() are special in that they use a
waitqueue whose lifetime is the current task, rather than the struct
file as is normally the case.  This is okay for blocking polls, since a
blocking poll occurs within one task; however, non-blocking polls
require another solution.  This solution is for the queue to be cleared
before it is freed, by sending a POLLFREE notification to all waiters.

Unfortunately, only eventpoll handles POLLFREE.  A second type of
non-blocking poll, aio poll, was added in kernel v4.18, and it doesn't
handle POLLFREE.  This allows a use-after-free to occur if a signalfd or
binder fd is polled with aio poll, and the waitqueue gets freed.

Fix this by making aio poll handle POLLFREE.

A patch by Ramji Jiyani <ramjiyani@google.com>
(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20211027011834.2497484-1-ramjiyani@google.com)
tried to do this by making aio_poll_wake() always complete the request
inline if POLLFREE is seen.  However, that solution had two bugs.
First, it introduced a deadlock, as it unconditionally locked the aio
context while holding the waitqueue lock, which inverts the normal
locking order.  Second, it didn't consider that POLLFREE notifications
are missed while the request has been temporarily de-queued.

The second problem was solved by my previous patch.  This patch then
properly fixes the use-after-free by handling POLLFREE in a
deadlock-free way.  It does this by taking advantage of the fact that
freeing of the waitqueue is RCU-delayed, similar to what eventpoll does.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/321fba81ec034f88aea4898993c1bf15605c023f"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4105e6a128e8a98455dfc9e6dbb2ab0c33c4497f"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/47ffefd88abfffe8a040bcc1dd0554d4ea6f7689"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/50252e4b5e989ce64555c7aef7516bdefc2fea72"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/60d311f9e6381d779d7d53371f87285698ecee24"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",True

nfsd: fix use-after-free due to delegation race

A delegation break could arrive as soon as we've called vfs_setlease.  A
delegation break runs a callback which immediately (in
nfsd4_cb_recall_prepare) adds the delegation to del_recall_lru.  If we
then exit nfs4_set_delegation without hashing the delegation, it will be
freed as soon as the callback is done with it, without ever being
removed from del_recall_lru.

Symptoms show up later as use-after-free or list corruption warnings,
usually in the laundromat thread.

I suspect aba2072f4523 ""nfsd: grant read delegations to clients holding
writes"" made this bug easier to hit, but I looked as far back as v3.0

In case brtfs_qgroup_reserve_data() or btrfs_delalloc_reserve_metadata()
fail the allocated extent_changeset will not be freed.

So in btrfs_check_data_free_space() and btrfs_delalloc_reserve_space()
free the allocated extent_changeset to get rid of the allocated memory.

The issue currently only happens in the direct IO write path, but only
after 65b3c08606e5 (""btrfs: fix ENOSPC failure when attempting direct IO
write into NOCOW range""), and also at defrag_one_locked_target(). Every

seg6: fix the iif in the IPv6 socket control block

When an IPv4 packet is received, the ip_rcv_core(...) sets the receiving
interface index into the IPv4 socket control block (v5.16-rc4,
net/ipv4/ip_input.c line 510):

    IPCB(skb)->iif = skb->skb_iif;

If that IPv4 packet is meant to be encapsulated in an outer IPv6+SRH
header, the seg6_do_srh_encap(...) performs the required encapsulation.
In this case, the seg6_do_srh_encap function clears the IPv6 socket control
block (v5.16-rc4 net/ipv6/seg6_iptunnel.c line 163):

    memset(IP6CB(skb), 0, sizeof(*IP6CB(skb)));

The memset(...) was introduced in commit ef489749aae5 (""ipv6: sr: clear
IP6CB(skb) on SRH ip4ip6 encapsulation"") a long time ago (2019-01-29).

Since the IPv6 socket control block and the IPv4 socket control block share
the same memory area (skb->cb), the receiving interface index info is lost
(IP6CB(skb)->iif is set to zero).

As a side effect, that condition triggers a NULL pointer dereference if
commit 0857d6f8c759 (""ipv6: When forwarding count rx stats on the orig
netdev"") is applied.

To fix that issue, we set the IP6CB(skb)->iif with the index of the
receiving interface once again.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6431e71093f3da586a00c6d931481ffb0dc2db0e"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/666521b3852d2b2f52d570f9122b1e4b50d96831"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/98adb2bbfa407c9290bda299d4c6f7a1c4ebd5e1"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ae68d93354e5bf5191ee673982251864ea24dd5c"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b16d412e5f79734033df04e97d7ea2f50a8e9fe3"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ef8804e47c0a44ae106ead1740408af5ea6c6ee9"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",True

ethtool: do not perform operations on net devices being unregistered

There is a short period between a net device starts to be unregistered
and when it is actually gone. In that time frame ethtool operations
could still be performed, which might end up in unwanted or undefined

Do not allow ethtool operations after a net device starts its
unregistration. This patch targets the netlink part as the ioctl one
isn't affected: the reference to the net device is taken and the
operation is executed within an rtnl lock section and the net device
won't be found after unregister.

serial: core: fix transmit-buffer reset and memleak

Commit 761ed4a94582 (""tty: serial_core: convert uart_close to use
tty_port_close"") converted serial core to use tty_port_close() but
failed to notice that the transmit buffer still needs to be freed on
final close.

Not freeing the transmit buffer means that the buffer is no longer
cleared on next open so that any ioctl() waiting for the buffer to drain
might wait indefinitely (e.g. on termios changes) or that stale data can
end up being transmitted in case tx is restarted.

Furthermore, the buffer of any port that has been opened would leak on
driver unbind.

Note that the port lock is held when clearing the buffer pointer due to
the ldisc race worked around by commit a5ba1d95e46e (""uart: fix race
between uart_put_char() and uart_shutdown()"").

Also note that the tty-port shutdown() callback is not called for
console ports so it is not strictly necessary to free the buffer page
after releasing the lock (cf. d72402145ace (""tty/serial: do not free
trasnmit buffer page under port lock"")).","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/00de977f9e0aa9760d9a79d1e41ff780f74e3424"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/011f6c92b5bf6e1fbfdedc8b5232f64c1c493206"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1179b168fa3f3a6aae3bd140000455a0e58457db"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/64e491c1634b73d3bddc081d08620bdc92ab2c12"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c5da8aa441053958594f94254592bb41264bdfbf"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e1722acf4f0d4d67b60f57e08ce16f8b66cd4b8f"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e74d9663fd57640fc3394abb5c76fa95b9cc2f2e"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations

drm/msm: Fix mmap to include VM_IO and VM_DONTDUMP

In commit 510410bfc034 (""drm/msm: Implement mmap as GEM object
function"") we switched to a new/cleaner method of doing things. That's
good, but we missed a little bit.

Before that commit, we used to _first_ run through the
drm_gem_mmap_obj() case where `obj->funcs->mmap()` was NULL. That meant
that we ran:

  vma->vm_flags |= VM_IO | VM_PFNMAP | VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP;
  vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_writecombine(vm_get_page_prot(vma->vm_flags));
  vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_decrypted(vma->vm_page_prot);

...and _then_ we modified those mappings with our own. Now that
`obj->funcs->mmap()` is no longer NULL we don't run the default
code. It looks like the fact that the vm_flags got VM_IO / VM_DONTDUMP
was important because we're now getting crashes on Chromebooks that
use ARC++ while logging out. Specifically a crash that looks like this
(this is on a 5.10 kernel w/ relevant backports but also seen on a
5.15 kernel):

While we're at it, the fact that we aren't running the default means
that we _don't_ need to clear out VM_PFNMAP, so remove that and save
an instruction.

problem I was seeing, but adding back VM_DONTDUMP seems like a sane

octeontx2-af: Fix a memleak bug in rvu_mbox_init()

In rvu_mbox_init(), mbox_regions is not freed or passed out
under the switch-default region, which could lead to a memory leak.

Fix this bug by changing 'return err' to 'goto free_regions'.

This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
(e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
the callers, so they constitute bugs.

Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
the bug.

Builds with CONFIG_OCTEONTX2_AF=y show no new warnings,

net: qlogic: qlcnic: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in qlcnic_83xx_add_rings()

In qlcnic_83xx_add_rings(), the indirect function of
ahw->hw_ops->alloc_mbx_args will be called to allocate memory for
cmd.req.arg, and there is a dereference of it in qlcnic_83xx_add_rings(),
which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference on failure of the
indirect function like qlcnic_83xx_alloc_mbx_args().

Fix this bug by adding a check of alloc_mbx_args(), this patch
imitates the logic of mbx_cmd()'s failure handling.

This bug was found by a static analyzer. The analysis employs
differential checking to identify inconsistent security operations
(e.g., checks or kfrees) between two code paths and confirms that the
inconsistent operations are not recovered in the current function or
the callers, so they constitute bugs.

Note that, as a bug found by static analysis, it can be a false
positive or hard to trigger. Multiple researchers have cross-reviewed
the bug.

tcp: fix page frag corruption on page fault

Steffen reported a TCP stream corruption for HTTP requests
served by the apache web-server using a cifs mount-point
and memory mapping the relevant file.

The root cause is quite similar to the one addressed by
commit 20eb4f29b602 (""net: fix sk_page_frag() recursion from
memory reclaim""). Here the nested access to the task page frag
is caused by a page fault on the (mmapped) user-space memory
buffer coming from the cifs file.

The page fault handler performs an smb transaction on a different
socket, inside the same process context. Since sk->sk_allaction
for such socket does not prevent the usage for the task_frag,
the nested allocation modify ""under the hood"" the page frag
in use by the outer sendmsg call, corrupting the stream.

The overall relevant stack trace looks like the following:

The cifs filesystem rightfully sets sk_allocations to GFP_NOFS,
we can avoid the nesting using the sk page frag for allocation
lacking the __GFP_FS flag. Do not define an additional mm-helper
for that, as this is strictly tied to the sk page frag usage.

ipv6: fix memory leak in fib6_rule_suppress

The kernel leaks memory when a `fib` rule is present in IPv6 nftables
firewall rules and a suppress_prefix rule is present in the IPv6 routing
rules (used by certain tools such as wg-quick). In such scenarios, every
incoming packet will leak an allocation in `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache.

After some hours of `bpftrace`-ing and source code reading, I tracked
down the issue to ca7a03c41753 (""ipv6: do not free rt if
FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule"").

The problem with that change is that the generic `args->flags` always have
`FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` set[1][2] but the IPv6-specific flag
`RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF` might not be, leading to `fib6_rule_suppress` not
decreasing the refcount when needed.

How to reproduce:
 - Add the following nftables rule to a prerouting chain:
     meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop
   This can be done with:
     sudo nft create table inet test
     sudo nft create chain inet test test_chain '{ type filter hook prerouting priority filter + 10; policy accept; }'
     sudo nft add rule inet test test_chain meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop
 - Run:
     sudo ip -6 rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0
 - Watch `sudo slabtop -o | grep ip6_dst_cache` to see memory usage increase
   with every incoming ipv6 packet.

This patch exposes the protocol-specific flags to the protocol
specific `suppress` function, and check the protocol-specific `flags`
argument for RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF instead of the generic
FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF when decreasing the refcount, like this.

blk-mq: cancel blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue and disk_release()

For avoiding to slow down queue destroy, we don't call
blk_mq_quiesce_queue() in blk_cleanup_queue(), instead of delaying to
cancel dispatch work in blk_release_queue().

However, this way has caused kernel oops[1], reported by Changhui. The log
shows that scsi_device can be freed before running blk_release_queue(),
which is expected too since scsi_device is released after the scsi disk
is closed and the scsi_device is removed.

Fixes the issue by canceling blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue()
and disk_release():

1) when disk_release() is run, the disk has been closed, and any sync
dispatch activities have been done, so canceling dispatch work is enough to
quiesce filesystem I/O dispatch activity.

2) in blk_cleanup_queue(), we only focus on passthrough request, and
passthrough request is always explicitly allocated & freed by
its caller, so once queue is frozen, all sync dispatch activity
for passthrough request has been done, then it is enough to just cancel
dispatch work for avoiding any dispatch activity.

sched/scs: Reset task stack state in bringup_cpu()

To hot unplug a CPU, the idle task on that CPU calls a few layers of C
code before finally leaving the kernel. When KASAN is in use, poisoned
shadow is left around for each of the active stack frames, and when
shadow call stacks are in use. When shadow call stacks (SCS) are in use
the task's saved SCS SP is left pointing at an arbitrary point within
the task's shadow call stack.

When a CPU is offlined than onlined back into the kernel, this stale
state can adversely affect execution. Stale KASAN shadow can alias new
stackframes and result in bogus KASAN warnings. A stale SCS SP is
effectively a memory leak, and prevents a portion of the shadow call
stack being used. Across a number of hotplug cycles the idle task's
entire shadow call stack can become unusable.

We previously fixed the KASAN issue in commit:

  e1b77c92981a5222 (""sched/kasan: remove stale KASAN poison after hotplug"")

... by removing any stale KASAN stack poison immediately prior to
onlining a CPU.

Subsequently in commit:

  f1a0a376ca0c4ef1 (""sched/core: Initialize the idle task with preemption disabled"")

... the refactoring left the KASAN and SCS cleanup in one-time idle
thread initialization code rather than something invoked prior to each
CPU being onlined, breaking both as above.

We fixed SCS (but not KASAN) in commit:

  63acd42c0d4942f7 (""sched/scs: Reset the shadow stack when idle_task_exit"")

... but as this runs in the context of the idle task being offlined it's
potentially fragile.

To fix these consistently and more robustly, reset the SCS SP and KASAN
shadow of a CPU's idle task immediately before we online that CPU in
bringup_cpu(). This ensures the idle task always has a consistent state
when it is running, and removes the need to so so when exiting an idle
task.

Whenever any thread is created, dup_task_struct() will give the task a
stack which is free of KASAN shadow, and initialize the task's SCS SP,
so there's no need to specially initialize either for idle thread within
init_idle(), as this was only necessary to handle hotplug cycles.

I've tested this on arm64 with:

* gcc 11.1.0, defconfig +KASAN_INLINE, KASAN_STACK
* clang 12.0.0, defconfig +KASAN_INLINE, KASAN_STACK, SHADOW_CALL_STACK

... offlining and onlining CPUS with:

net: vlan: fix underflow for the real_dev refcnt

Inject error before dev_hold(real_dev) in register_vlan_dev(),
and execute the following testcase:

ip link add dev dummy1 type dummy
ip link add name dummy1.100 link dummy1 type vlan id 100
ip link del dev dummy1

When the dummy netdevice is removed, we will get a WARNING as following:

That is because dev_put(real_dev) in vlan_dev_free() be called without
dev_hold(real_dev) in register_vlan_dev(). It makes the refcnt of real_dev
underflow.

Move the dev_hold(real_dev) to vlan_dev_init() which is the call-back of
ndo_init(). That makes dev_hold() and dev_put() for vlan's real_dev

ethtool: ioctl: fix potential NULL deref in ethtool_set_coalesce()

ethtool_set_coalesce() now uses both the .get_coalesce() and
.set_coalesce() callbacks. But the check for their availability is
buggy, so changing the coalesce settings on a device where the driver
provides only _one_ of the callbacks results in a NULL pointer
dereference instead of an -EOPNOTSUPP.

Fix the condition so that the availability of both callbacks is
ensured. This also matches the netlink code.

Note that reproducing this requires some effort - it only affects the
legacy ioctl path, and needs a specific combination of driver options:
- have .get_coalesce() and .coalesce_supported but no
 .set_coalesce(), or
- have .set_coalesce() but no .get_coalesce(). Here eg. ethtool doesn't
  cause the crash as it first attempts to call ethtool_get_coalesce()

ice: avoid bpf_prog refcount underflow

Ice driver has the routines for managing XDP resources that are shared
between ndo_bpf op and VSI rebuild flow. The latter takes place for
example when user changes queue count on an interface via ethtool's
set_channels().

There is an issue around the bpf_prog refcounting when VSI is being
rebuilt - since ice_prepare_xdp_rings() is called with vsi->xdp_prog as
an argument that is used later on by ice_vsi_assign_bpf_prog(), same
bpf_prog pointers are swapped with each other. Then it is also
interpreted as an 'old_prog' which in turn causes us to call
bpf_prog_put on it that will decrement its refcount.

Below splat can be interpreted in a way that due to zero refcount of a
bpf_prog it is wiped out from the system while kernel still tries to
refer to it:

Some x86-64 CPUs have a CPU feature called ""Supervisor Mode Access
Prevention (SMAP)"", which is used to detect wrong access from the kernel
to user buffers like this: SMAP triggers a permissions violation on
wrong access.  In the x86-64 variant of clear_user(), SMAP is properly
handled via clac()+stac().

To fix, properly use clear_user() when we're dealing with a user buffer.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/33a7d698f30fa0b99d50569e9909d3baa65d8f6a"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7b3a34f08d11e7f05cd00b8e09adaa15192f0ad1"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/99d348b82bcb36171f24411d3f1a15706a2a937a"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9ef384ed300d1bcfb23d0ab0b487d544444d4b52"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a8a917058faf4abaec9fb614bb6d5f8fe3529ec6"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a9e164bd160be8cbee1df70acb379129e3cd2e7c"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c1e63117711977cc4295b2ce73de29dd17066c82"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fd7974c547abfb03072a4ee706d3a6f182266f89"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

net: nexthop: fix null pointer dereference when IPv6 is not enabled

When we try to add an IPv6 nexthop and IPv6 is not enabled
(!CONFIG_IPV6) we'll hit a NULL pointer dereference[1] in the error path
of nh_create_ipv6() due to calling ipv6_stub->fib6_nh_release. The bug
has been present since the beginning of IPv6 nexthop gateway support.
Commit 1aefd3de7bc6 (""ipv6: Add fib6_nh_init and release to stubs"") tells
us that only fib6_nh_init has a dummy stub because fib6_nh_release should
not be called if fib6_nh_init returns an error, but the commit below added
a call to ipv6_stub->fib6_nh_release in its error path. To fix it return
the dummy stub's -EAFNOSUPPORT error directly without calling
ipv6_stub->fib6_nh_release in nh_create_ipv6()'s error path.

 Output is a bit truncated, but it clearly shows the error.

A vulnerability that exists prior to commit 48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e impacts all users who have performed verification with an instance of MIT IdentiBot that meets the following conditions: The instance of IdentiBot is tied to a ""public"" Discord applicationâi.e., users other than the API access registrant can add it to servers; *and* the instance has not yet been patched. In affected versions, IdentiBot does not check that a server is authorized before allowing members to execute slash and user commands in that server. As a result, any user can join IdentiBot to their server and then use commands (e.g., `/kerbid`) to reveal the full name and other information about a Discord user who has verified their affiliation with MIT using IdentiBot. The latest version of MIT IdentiBot contains a patch for this vulnerability (implemented in commit 48e3e5e7ead6777fa75d57c7711c8e55b501c24e). There is no way to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability without the patch.

Minder prior to version 0.0.51 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack which could allow an attacker to crash the Minder server and deny other users access to it. The root cause of the vulnerability is that Minders sigstore verifier reads an untrusted response entirely into memory without enforcing a limit on the response body. An attacker can exploit this by making Minder make a request to an attacker-controlled endpoint which returns a response with a large body which will crash the Minder server. Specifically, the point of failure is where Minder parses the response from the GitHub attestations endpoint in `getAttestationReply`. Here, Minder makes a request to the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub endpoint (line 285) and then parses the response into the `AttestationReply` (line 295). The way Minder parses the response on line 295 makes it prone to DoS if the response is large enough. Essentially, the response needs to be larger than the machine has available memory.  Version 0.0.51 contains a patch for this issue.

The content that is hosted at the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub attestation endpoint is controlled by users including unauthenticated users to Minders threat model. However, a user will need to configure their own Minder settings to cause Minder to make Minder send a request to fetch the attestations. The user would need to know of a package whose attestations were configured in such a way that they would return a large response when fetching them. As such, the steps needed to carry out this attack would look as such:

1. The attacker adds a package to ghcr.io with attestations that can be fetched via the `orgs/$owner/attestations/$checksumref` GitHub endpoint.
2. The attacker registers on Minder and makes Minder fetch the attestations.
3. Minder fetches attestations and crashes thereby being denied of service.","5.30","CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","0.00","","[{""source"": ""security-advisories@github.com"", ""type"": ""Secondary"", ""description"": [{""lang"": ""en"", ""value"": ""CWE-770""}]}]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/daccbc12e364e2d407d56b87a13f7bb24cbdb074/internal/verifier/sigstore/container/container.go#L271-L300"", ""source"": ""security-advisories@github.com""}, {""url"": ""https://github.com/stacklok/minder/commit/fe321d345b4f738de6a06b13207addc72b59f892"", ""source"": ""security-advisories@github.com""}, {""url"": ""https://github.com/stacklok/minder/security/advisories/GHSA-8fmj-33gw-g7pw"", ""source"": ""security-advisories@github.com""}]",False

As stated in the Python docs, a special form for address is accepted instead of a host address: `''` represents `INADDR_ANY`, equivalent to `""0.0.0.0""`. On systems with IPv6, '' represents `IN6ADDR_ANY`, which is equivalent to `""::""`. A user who serves docs on an unsecured public network, may unknowingly be hosting an unsecured (http) web site for any remote user/system to access on the same network. The issue has has been mitigated in dbt-core v1.6.15, dbt-core v1.7.15, and dbt-core v1.8.1 by binding to localhost explicitly by default in `dbt docs serve`.

tcp: do not accept ACK of bytes we never sent

This patch is based on a detailed report and ideas from Yepeng Pan
and Christian Rossow.

ACK seq validation is currently following RFC 5961 5.2 guidelines:

   The ACK value is considered acceptable only if
   it is in the range of ((SND.UNA - MAX.SND.WND) <= SEG.ACK <=
   SND.NXT).  All incoming segments whose ACK value doesn't satisfy the
   above condition MUST be discarded and an ACK sent back.  It needs to
   be noted that RFC 793 on page 72 (fifth check) says: ""If the ACK is a
   duplicate (SEG.ACK < SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If the ACK
   acknowledges something not yet sent (SEG.ACK > SND.NXT) then send an
   ACK, drop the segment, and return"".  The ""ignored"" above implies that
   the processing of the incoming data segment continues, which means
   the ACK value is treated as acceptable.  This mitigation makes the
   ACK check more stringent since any ACK < SND.UNA wouldn't be
   accepted, instead only ACKs that are in the range ((SND.UNA -
   MAX.SND.WND) <= SEG.ACK <= SND.NXT) get through.

This can be refined for new (and possibly spoofed) flows,
by not accepting ACK for bytes that were never sent.

This greatly improves TCP security at a little cost.

I added a Fixes: tag to make sure this patch will reach stable trees,
even if the 'blamed' patch was adhering to the RFC.

tp->bytes_acked was added in linux-4.2

Following packetdrill test (courtesy of Yepeng Pan) shows
the issue at hand:

tty: n_gsm: fix possible out-of-bounds in gsm0_receive()

Assuming the following:
- side A configures the n_gsm in basic option mode
- side B sends the header of a basic option mode frame with data length 1
- side A switches to advanced option mode
- side B sends 2 data bytes which exceeds gsm->len
  Reason: gsm->len is not used in advanced option mode.
- side A switches to basic option mode
- side B keeps sending until gsm0_receive() writes past gsm->buf
  Reason: Neither gsm->state nor gsm->len have been reset after
  reconfiguration.

Fix this by changing gsm->count to gsm->len comparison from equal to less
than. Also add upper limit checks against the constant MAX_MRU in
gsm0_receive() and gsm1_receive() to harden against memory corruption of
gsm->len and gsm->mru.

All other checks remain as we still need to limit the data according to the
user configuration and actual payload size.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0fb736c9931e02dbc7d9a75044c8e1c039e50f04"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/46f52c89a7e7d2691b97a9728e4591d071ca8abc"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/47388e807f85948eefc403a8a5fdc5b406a65d5a"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4c267110fc110390704cc065edb9817fdd10ff54"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/774d83b008eccb1c48c14dc5486e7aa255731350"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9513d4148950b05bc99fa7314dc883cc0e1605e5"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b229bc6c6ea9fe459fc3fa94fd0a27a2f32aca56"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b890d45aaf02b564e6cae2d2a590f9649330857d"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f126ce7305fe88f49cdabc6db4168b9318898ea3"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

All decompressor implementations of Aircompressor (LZ4, LZO, Snappy, Zstandard) can crash the JVM for certain input, and in some cases also leak the content of other memory of the Java process (which could contain sensitive information). When decompressing certain data, the decompressors try to access memory outside the bounds of the given byte arrays or byte buffers. Because Aircompressor uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. Users should update to Aircompressor 0.27 or newer where these issues have been fixed. When decompressing data from untrusted users, this can be exploited for a denial-of-service attack by crashing the JVM, or to leak other sensitive information from the Java process.

btrfs: zoned: do not flag ZEROOUT on non-dirty extent buffer

Btrfs clears the content of an extent buffer marked as
EXTENT_BUFFER_ZONED_ZEROOUT before the bio submission. This mechanism is
introduced to prevent a write hole of an extent buffer, which is once
allocated, marked dirty, but turns out unnecessary and cleaned up within
one transaction operation.

Currently, btrfs_clear_buffer_dirty() marks the extent buffer as
EXTENT_BUFFER_ZONED_ZEROOUT, and skips the entry function. If this call
happens while the buffer is under IO (with the WRITEBACK flag set,
without the DIRTY flag), we can add the ZEROOUT flag and clear the
buffer's content just before a bio submission. As a result:

1) it can lead to adding faulty delayed reference item which leads to a
   FS corrupted (EUCLEAN) error, and

2) it writes out cleared tree node on disk

The former issue is previously discussed in [1]. The corruption happens
when it runs a delayed reference update. So, on-disk data is safe.

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/3f4f2a0ff1a6c818050434288925bdcf3cd719e5.1709124777.git.naohiro.aota@wdc.com/

The latter one can reach on-disk data. But, as that node is already
processed by btrfs_clear_buffer_dirty(), that will be invalidated in the
next transaction commit anyway. So, the chance of hitting the corruption
is relatively small.

Anyway, we should skip flagging ZEROOUT on a non-DIRTY extent buffer, to
keep the content under IO intact.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/68879386180c0efd5a11e800b0525a01068c9457"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f4b994fccbb6f294c4b31a6ca0114b09f7245043"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

mm/userfaultfd: reset ptes when close() for wr-protected ones

Userfaultfd unregister includes a step to remove wr-protect bits from all
the relevant pgtable entries, but that only covered an explicit
UFFDIO_UNREGISTER ioctl, not a close() on the userfaultfd itself.  Cover
that too.  This fixes a WARN trace.

The only user visible side effect is the user can observe leftover
wr-protect bits even if the user close()ed on an userfaultfd when
releasing the last reference of it.  However hopefully that should be
harmless, and nothing bad should happen even if so.

This change is now more important after the recent page-table-check
patch we merged in mm-unstable (446dd9ad37d0 (""mm/page_table_check:
support userfault wr-protect entries"")), as we'll do sanity check on
uffd-wp bits without vma context.  So it's better if we can 100%

net: fix out-of-bounds access in ops_init

net_alloc_generic is called by net_alloc, which is called without any
locking. It reads max_gen_ptrs, which is changed under pernet_ops_rwsem. It
is read twice, first to allocate an array, then to set s.len, which is
later used to limit the bounds of the array access.

It is possible that the array is allocated and another thread is
registering a new pernet ops, increments max_gen_ptrs, which is then used
to set s.len with a larger than allocated length for the variable array.

Fix it by reading max_gen_ptrs only once in net_alloc_generic. If
max_gen_ptrs is later incremented, it will be caught in net_assign_generic.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0c3248bc708a7797be573214065cf908ff1f54c7"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2d60ff5874aefd006717ca5e22ac1e25eac29c42"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3cdc34d76c4f777579e28ad373979d36c030cfd3"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7b0e64583eab8c1d896b47e5dd0bf2e7d86ec41f"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9518b79bfd2fbf99fa9b7e8e36bcb1825e7ba030"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a26ff37e624d12e28077e5b24d2b264f62764ad6"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b6dbfd5bcc267a95a0bf1bf96af46243f96ec6cd"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f4f94587e1bf87cb40ec33955a9d90148dd026ab"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

iommu/arm-smmu: Use the correct type in nvidia_smmu_context_fault()

This was missed because of the function pointer indirection.

nvidia_smmu_context_fault() is also installed as a irq function, and the
'void *' was changed to a struct arm_smmu_domain. Since the iommu_domain
is embedded at a non-zero offset this causes nvidia_smmu_context_fault()
to miscompute the offset. Fixup the types.

to mask __pod_cpumask with cpu_online_mask. In case no cpu is left in
the pool, skip the assignment.

tj: This doesn't fully fix the bug as CPUs can still go down between picking
the target CPU and the wake call. Fixing that likely requires adding
cpu_online() test to either the sched or s390 arch code. However, regardless
of how that is fixed, workqueue shouldn't be picking a CPU which isn't
online as that would result in unpredictable and worse behavior.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/57a01eafdcf78f6da34fad9ff075ed5dfdd9f420"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6d559e70b3eb6623935cbe7f94c1912c1099777b"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c57824d4fe07c2131f8c48687cbd5ee2be60c767"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

When fallback to TCP happens early on a client socket, snd_nxt
is not yet initialized and any incoming ack will copy such value
into snd_una. If the mptcp worker (dumbly) tries mptcp-level
re-injection after such ack, that would unconditionally trigger a send
buffer cleanup using 'bad' snd_una values.

We could easily disable re-injection for fallback sockets, but such
dumb behavior already helped catching a few subtle issues and a very
low to zero impact in practice.

Instead address the issue always initializing snd_nxt (and write_seq,
for consistency) at connect time.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/39ca83ed73db9edcc6d70c0dc7a73085a4725012"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/592f69b41766d366dbb8ff4ef5a67c4396527bbe"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/99951b62bf20cec9247f633a3bea898338b9e5b4"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aa0c07c1f20e05b30019bff083ec43665536f06f"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dc941fec0719d0471a5902424d6b2a17df233193"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fb7a0d334894206ae35f023a82cad5a290fd7386"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

mm/slub: avoid zeroing outside-object freepointer for single free

Commit 284f17ac13fe (""mm/slub: handle bulk and single object freeing
separately"") splits single and bulk object freeing in two functions
slab_free() and slab_free_bulk() which leads slab_free() to call
slab_free_hook() directly instead of slab_free_freelist_hook().

If `init_on_free` is set, slab_free_hook() zeroes the object.
Afterward, if `slub_debug=F` and `CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED` are
set, the do_slab_free() slowpath executes freelist consistency
checks and try to decode a zeroed freepointer which leads to a
""Freepointer corrupt"" detection in check_object().

During bulk free, slab_free_freelist_hook() isn't affected as it always
sets it objects freepointer using set_freepointer() to maintain its
reconstructed freelist after `init_on_free`.

For single free, object's freepointer thus needs to be avoided when
stored outside the object if `init_on_free` is set. The freepointer left
as is, check_object() may later detect an invalid pointer value due to
objects overflow.

To reproduce, set `slub_debug=FU init_on_free=1 log_level=7` on the
command line of a kernel build with `CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED=y`.

usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix race between aio_cancel() and AIO request complete

FFS based applications can utilize the aio_cancel() callback to dequeue
pending USB requests submitted to the UDC.  There is a scenario where the
FFS application issues an AIO cancel call, while the UDC is handling a
soft disconnect.  For a DWC3 based implementation, the callstack looks
like the following:

    DWC3 Gadget                               FFS Application
dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect()              ...
  --> dwc3_stop_active_transfers()
    --> dwc3_gadget_giveback(-ESHUTDOWN)
      --> ffs_epfile_async_io_complete()   ffs_aio_cancel()
        --> usb_ep_free_request()            --> usb_ep_dequeue()

There is currently no locking implemented between the AIO completion
handler and AIO cancel, so the issue occurs if the completion routine is
running in parallel to an AIO cancel call coming from the FFS application.
As the completion call frees the USB request (io_data->req) the FFS
application is also referencing it for the usb_ep_dequeue() call.  This can
lead to accessing a stale/hanging pointer.

commit b566d38857fc (""usb: gadget: f_fs: use io_data->status consistently"")
relocated the usb_ep_free_request() into ffs_epfile_async_io_complete().
However, in order to properly implement locking to mitigate this issue, the
spinlock can't be added to ffs_epfile_async_io_complete(), as
usb_ep_dequeue() (if successfully dequeuing a USB request) will call the
function driver's completion handler in the same context.  Hence, leading
into a deadlock.

Fix this issue by moving the usb_ep_free_request() back to
ffs_user_copy_worker(), and ensuring that it explicitly sets io_data->req
to NULL after freeing it within the ffs->eps_lock.  This resolves the race
condition above, as the ffs_aio_cancel() routine will not continue
attempting to dequeue a request that has already been freed, or the
ffs_user_copy_work() not freeing the USB request until the AIO cancel is
done referencing it.

This fix depends on

usb: gadget: uvc: use correct buffer size when parsing configfs lists

This commit fixes uvc gadget support on 32-bit platforms.

Commit 0df28607c5cb (""usb: gadget: uvc: Generalise helper functions for
reuse"") introduced a helper function __uvcg_iter_item_entries() to aid
with parsing lists of items on configfs attributes stores. This function
is a generalization of another very similar function, which used a
stack-allocated temporary buffer of fixed size for each item in the list
and used the sizeof() operator to check for potential buffer overruns.
The new function was changed to allocate the now variably sized temp
buffer on heap, but wasn't properly updated to also check for max buffer
size using the computed size instead of sizeof() operator.

As a result, the maximum item size was 7 (plus null terminator) on
64-bit platforms, and 3 on 32-bit ones. While 7 is accidentally just
barely enough, 3 is definitely too small for some of UVC configfs
attributes. For example, dwFrameInteval, specified in 100ns units,
usually has 6-digit item values, e.g. 166666 for 60fps.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/650ae71c80749fc7cb8858c8049f532eaec64410"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7a54e5052bde582fd0e7677334fe7a5be92e242c"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a422089ce42ced73713e5032aad29a9a7cbe9528"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

gpiolib: cdev: Fix use after free in lineinfo_changed_notify

The use-after-free issue occurs as follows: when the GPIO chip device file
is being closed by invoking gpio_chrdev_release(), watched_lines is freed
by bitmap_free(), but the unregistration of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier
chain failed due to waiting write rwsem. Additionally, one of the GPIO
chip's lines is also in the release process and holds the notifier chain's
read rwsem. Consequently, a race condition leads to the use-after-free of
watched_lines.

Here is the typical stack when issue happened:

[free]
gpio_chrdev_release()
  --> bitmap_free(cdev->watched_lines)                  <-- freed
  --> blocking_notifier_chain_unregister()
    --> down_write(&nh->rwsem)                          <-- waiting rwsem
          --> __down_write_common()
            --> rwsem_down_write_slowpath()
                  --> schedule_preempt_disabled()
                    --> schedule()

[use]
st54spi_gpio_dev_release()
  --> gpio_free()
    --> gpiod_free()
      --> gpiod_free_commit()
        --> gpiod_line_state_notify()
          --> blocking_notifier_call_chain()
            --> down_read(&nh->rwsem);                  <-- held rwsem
            --> notifier_call_chain()
              --> lineinfo_changed_notify()
                --> test_bit(xxxx, cdev->watched_lines) <-- use after free

The side effect of the use-after-free issue is that a GPIO line event is
being generated for userspace where it shouldn't. However, since the chrdev
is being closed, userspace won't have the chance to read that event anyway.

To fix the issue, call the bitmap_free() function after the unregistration
of lineinfo_changed_nb notifier chain.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/02f6b0e1ec7e0e7d059dddc893645816552039da"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/95ca7c90eaf5ea8a8460536535101e3e81160e2a"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ca710b5f40b8b16fdcad50bebd47f50e4c62d239"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

tcp: Use refcount_inc_not_zero() in tcp_twsk_unique().

Anderson Nascimento reported a use-after-free splat in tcp_twsk_unique()
with nice analysis.

Since commit ec94c2696f0b (""tcp/dccp: avoid one atomic operation for
timewait hashdance""), inet_twsk_hashdance() sets TIME-WAIT socket's
sk_refcnt after putting it into ehash and releasing the bucket lock.

Thus, there is a small race window where other threads could try to
reuse the port during connect() and call sock_hold() in tcp_twsk_unique()
for the TIME-WAIT socket with zero refcnt.

If that happens, the refcnt taken by tcp_twsk_unique() is overwritten
and sock_put() will cause underflow, triggering a real use-after-free
somewhere else.

To avoid the use-after-free, we need to use refcount_inc_not_zero() in
tcp_twsk_unique() and give up on reusing the port if it returns false.

[0]:
refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.

tcp: defer shutdown(SEND_SHUTDOWN) for TCP_SYN_RECV sockets

TCP_SYN_RECV state is really special, it is only used by
cross-syn connections, mostly used by fuzzers.

In the following crash [1], syzbot managed to trigger a divide
by zero in tcp_rcv_space_adjust()

A socket makes the following state transitions,
without ever calling tcp_init_transfer(),
meaning tcp_init_buffer_space() is also not called.

         TCP_CLOSE
connect()
         TCP_SYN_SENT
         TCP_SYN_RECV
shutdown() -> tcp_shutdown(sk, SEND_SHUTDOWN)
         TCP_FIN_WAIT1

To fix this issue, change tcp_shutdown() to not
perform a TCP_SYN_RECV -> TCP_FIN_WAIT1 transition,
which makes no sense anyway.

When tcp_rcv_state_process() later changes socket state
from TCP_SYN_RECV to TCP_ESTABLISH, then look at
sk->sk_shutdown to finally enter TCP_FIN_WAIT1 state,
and send a FIN packet from a sane socket state.

This means tcp_send_fin() can now be called from BH
context, and must use GFP_ATOMIC allocations.

We find the root cause of this OOB is that arm does not clear stale stack
poison in the case of cpuidle.

This patch refer to arch/arm64/kernel/sleep.S to resolve this issue.

From cited commit [1] that explain the problem

Functions which the compiler has instrumented for KASAN place poison on
the stack shadow upon entry and remove this poison prior to returning.

In the case of cpuidle, CPUs exit the kernel a number of levels deep in
C code.  Any instrumented functions on this critical path will leave
portions of the stack shadow poisoned.

If CPUs lose context and return to the kernel via a cold path, we
restore a prior context saved in __cpu_suspend_enter are forgotten, and
we never remove the poison they placed in the stack shadow area by
functions calls between this and the actual exit of the kernel.

Thus, (depending on stackframe layout) subsequent calls to instrumented
functions may hit this stale poison, resulting in (spurious) KASAN
splats to the console.

To avoid this, clear any stale poison from the idle thread for a CPU
prior to bringing a CPU online.

blk-iocost: do not WARN if iocg was already offlined

In iocg_pay_debt(), warn is triggered if 'active_list' is empty, which
is intended to confirm iocg is active when it has debt. However, warn
can be triggered during a blkcg or disk removal, if iocg_waitq_timer_fn()
is run at that time:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2344971 at block/blk-iocost.c:1402 iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190
  Call trace:
  iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190

  __run_hrtimer+0x144/0x45c
  __hrtimer_run_queues+0x16c/0x244
  hrtimer_interrupt+0x2cc/0x7b0

The warn in this situation is meaningless. Since this iocg is being
removed, the state of the 'active_list' is irrelevant, and 'waitq_timer'
is canceled after removing 'active_list' in ioc_pd_free(), which ensures
iocg is freed after iocg_waitq_timer_fn() returns.

Therefore, add the check if iocg was already offlined to avoid warn
when removing a blkcg or disk.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/01bc4fda9ea0a6b52f12326486f07a4910666cf6"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/14b3275f93d4a0d8ddc02195bc4e9869b7a3700e"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c172ac7afe4442964f4153b2c78fe4e005d9d67"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

Avoid that undefined behavior by simply taking the

powerpc/pseries/iommu: LPAR panics during boot up with a frozen PE

At the time of LPAR boot up, partition firmware provides Open Firmware
property ibm,dma-window for the PE. This property is provided on the PCI
bus the PE is attached to.

There are execptions where the partition firmware might not provide this
property for the PE at the time of LPAR boot up. One of the scenario is
where the firmware has frozen the PE due to some error condition. This
PE is frozen for 24 hours or unless the whole system is reinitialized.

Within this time frame, if the LPAR is booted, the frozen PE will be
presented to the LPAR but ibm,dma-window property could be missing.

Today, under these circumstances, the LPAR oopses with NULL pointer
dereference, when configuring the PCI bus the PE is attached to.

ipv4: Fix uninit-value access in __ip_make_skb()

KMSAN reported uninit-value access in __ip_make_skb() [1].  __ip_make_skb()
tests HDRINCL to know if the skb has icmphdr. However, HDRINCL can cause a
race condition. If calling setsockopt(2) with IP_HDRINCL changes HDRINCL
while __ip_make_skb() is running, the function will access icmphdr in the
skb even if it is not included. This causes the issue reported by KMSAN.

Check FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH on fl4->flowi4_flags instead of testing HDRINCL
on the socket.

Also, fl4->fl4_icmp_type and fl4->fl4_icmp_code are not initialized. These
are union in struct flowi4 and are implicitly initialized by
flowi4_init_output(), but we should not rely on specific union layout.

Initialize these explicitly in raw_sendmsg().

Analysis:
There is one napi structure per out_q: card->qdio.out_qs[i].napi
The napi.poll functions are set during qeth_open().

Since
commit 1cfef80d4c2b (""s390/qeth: Don't call dev_close/dev_open (DOWN/UP)"")
qeth_set_offline()/qeth_set_online() no longer call dev_close()/
dev_open(). So if qeth_free_qdio_queues() cleared
card->qdio.out_qs[i].napi.poll while the network interface was UP and the
card was offline, they are not set again.

thermal/debugfs: Prevent use-after-free from occurring after cdev removal

Since thermal_debug_cdev_remove() does not run under cdev->lock, it can
run in parallel with thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() and it may free
the struct thermal_debugfs object used by the latter after it has been
checked against NULL.

If that happens, thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() will access memory
that has been freed already causing the kernel to crash.

Address this by using cdev->lock in thermal_debug_cdev_remove() around
the cdev->debugfs value check (in case the same cdev is removed at the
same time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.

nsh: Restore skb->{protocol,data,mac_header} for outer header in nsh_gso_segment().

syzbot triggered various splats (see [0] and links) by a crafted GSO
packet of VIRTIO_NET_HDR_GSO_UDP layering the following protocols:

  ETH_P_8021AD + ETH_P_NSH + ETH_P_IPV6 + IPPROTO_UDP

NSH can encapsulate IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet, NSH, and MPLS.  As the inner
protocol can be Ethernet, NSH GSO handler, nsh_gso_segment(), calls
skb_mac_gso_segment() to invoke inner protocol GSO handlers.

nsh_gso_segment() does the following for the original skb before
calling skb_mac_gso_segment()

  1. reset skb->network_header
  2. save the original skb->{mac_heaeder,mac_len} in a local variable
  3. pull the NSH header
  4. resets skb->mac_header
  5. set up skb->mac_len and skb->protocol for the inner protocol.

and does the following for the segmented skb

  6. set ntohs(ETH_P_NSH) to skb->protocol
  7. push the NSH header
  8. restore skb->mac_header
  9. set skb->mac_header + mac_len to skb->network_header
 10. restore skb->mac_len

There are two problems in 6-7 and 8-9.

  (a)
  After 6 & 7, skb->data points to the NSH header, so the outer header
  (ETH_P_8021AD in this case) is stripped when skb is sent out of netdev.

  Also, if NSH is encapsulated by NSH + Ethernet (so NSH-Ethernet-NSH),
  skb_pull() in the first nsh_gso_segment() will make skb->data point
  to the middle of the outer NSH or Ethernet header because the Ethernet
  header is not pulled by the second nsh_gso_segment().

  (b)
  While restoring skb->{mac_header,network_header} in 8 & 9,
  nsh_gso_segment() does not assume that the data in the linear
  buffer is shifted.

  However, udp6_ufo_fragment() could shift the data and change
  skb->mac_header accordingly as demonstrated by syzbot.

  If this happens, even the restored skb->mac_header points to
  the middle of the outer header.

It seems nsh_gso_segment() has never worked with outer headers so far.

At the end of nsh_gso_segment(), the outer header must be restored for
the segmented skb, instead of the NSH header.

To do that, let's calculate the outer header position relatively from
the inner header and set skb->{data,mac_header,protocol} properly.

Commit 50e782a86c98 (""efi/unaccepted: Fix soft lockups caused by

do memory acceptance in parallel and not triggers softlockup on other
CPUs.

However the softlock up was intermittent shown up if the memory of the
TD guest is large, and the timeout of softlockup is set to 1 second:

When the local irq is enabled at the end of accept_memory(), the
softlockup detects that the watchdog on single CPU has not been fed for
a while. That is to say, even other CPUs will not be blocked by
spinlock, the current CPU might be stunk with local irq disabled for a
while, which hurts not only nmi watchdog but also softlockup.

Chao Gao pointed out that the memory accept could be time costly and
there was similar report before. Thus to avoid any softlocup detection
during this stage, give the softlockup a flag to skip the timeout check
at the end of accept_memory(), by invoking touch_softlockup_watchdog().","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c5a1627f48105cbab81d25ec2f72232bfaa8185"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/781e34b736014188ba9e46a71535237313dcda81"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

xdp: use flags field to disambiguate broadcast redirect

When redirecting a packet using XDP, the bpf_redirect_map() helper will set
up the redirect destination information in struct bpf_redirect_info (using
the __bpf_xdp_redirect_map() helper function), and the xdp_do_redirect()
function will read this information after the XDP program returns and pass
the frame on to the right redirect destination.

When using the BPF_F_BROADCAST flag to do multicast redirect to a whole
map, __bpf_xdp_redirect_map() sets the 'map' pointer in struct
bpf_redirect_info to point to the destination map to be broadcast. And
xdp_do_redirect() reacts to the value of this map pointer to decide whether
it's dealing with a broadcast or a single-value redirect. However, if the
destination map is being destroyed before xdp_do_redirect() is called, the
map pointer will be cleared out (by bpf_clear_redirect_map()) without
waiting for any XDP programs to stop running. This causes xdp_do_redirect()
to think that the redirect was to a single target, but the target pointer
is also NULL (since broadcast redirects don't have a single target), so
this causes a crash when a NULL pointer is passed to dev_map_enqueue().

To fix this, change xdp_do_redirect() to react directly to the presence of
the BPF_F_BROADCAST flag in the 'flags' value in struct bpf_redirect_info
to disambiguate between a single-target and a broadcast redirect. And only
read the 'map' pointer if the broadcast flag is set, aborting if that has
been cleared out in the meantime. This prevents the crash, while keeping
the atomic (cmpxchg-based) clearing of the map pointer itself, and without
adding any more checks in the non-broadcast fast path.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/12481f30128fbebc2eeb55eb2d56390fdfa30c5e"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/272bfb019f3cc018f654b992115774e77b4f3ffc"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5bcf0dcbf9066348058b88a510c57f70f384c92c"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6fd81f9d333e7b3532036577b1beb74ba1323553"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e22e25820fa04ea5eaac4ef7ee200e9923f466a4"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

Prior to this, commit 4cd12c6065df (""bpf, sockmap: Fix NULL pointer
dereference in sk_psock_verdict_data_ready()"") fixed one NULL pointer
similarly due to no protection of saved_data_ready. Here is another
different caller causing the same issue because of the same reason. So
we should protect it with sk_callback_lock read lock because the writer
side in the sk_psock_drop() uses ""write_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);"".

To avoid errors that could happen in future, I move those two pairs of
lock into the sk_psock_data_ready(), which is suggested by John Fastabend.","5.50","CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","0.00","","[{""source"": ""nvd@nist.gov"", ""type"": ""Primary"", ""description"": [{""lang"": ""en"", ""value"": ""CWE-476""}]}]","[{""nodes"": [{""operator"": ""OR"", ""negate"": false, ""cpeMatch"": [{""vulnerable"": true, ""criteria"": ""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"", ""versionStartIncluding"": ""4.20"", ""versionEndExcluding"": ""5.15.159"", ""matchCriteriaId"": ""6FB93658-2709-4338-A4A2-4EF2B669AC04""}, {""vulnerable"": true, ""criteria"": ""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"", ""versionStartIncluding"": ""5.16"", ""versionEndExcluding"": ""6.1.91"", ""matchCriteriaId"": ""4F8C886C-75AA-469B-A6A9-12BF1A29C0D5""}, {""vulnerable"": true, ""criteria"": ""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"", ""versionStartIncluding"": ""6.2"", ""versionEndExcluding"": ""6.6.31"", ""matchCriteriaId"": ""CDDB1F69-36AC-41C1-9192-E7CCEF5FFC00""}, {""vulnerable"": true, ""criteria"": ""cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"", ""versionStartIncluding"": ""6.7"", ""versionEndExcluding"": ""6.8.10"", ""matchCriteriaId"": ""6A6B920C-8D8F-4130-86B4-AD334F4CF2E3""}]}]}]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/39dc9e1442385d6e9be0b6491ee488dddd55ae27"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"", ""tags"": [""Patch""]}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5965bc7535fb87510b724e5465ccc1a1cf00916d"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"", ""tags"": [""Patch""]}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6648e613226e18897231ab5e42ffc29e63fa3365"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"", ""tags"": [""Patch""]}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/772d5729b5ff0df0d37b32db600ce635b2172f80"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"", ""tags"": [""Patch""]}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b397a0ab8582c533ec0c6b732392f141fc364f87"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"", ""tags"": [""Patch""]}]",False

nfs: Handle error of rpc_proc_register() in nfs_net_init().

syzkaller reported a warning [0] triggered while destroying immature
netns.

rpc_proc_register() was called in init_nfs_fs(), but its error
has been ignored since at least the initial commit 1da177e4c3f4
(""Linux-2.6.12-rc2"").

Recently, commit d47151b79e32 (""nfs: expose /proc/net/sunrpc/nfs
in net namespaces"") converted the procfs to per-netns and made
the problem more visible.

Even when rpc_proc_register() fails, nfs_net_init() could succeed,
and thus nfs_net_exit() will be called while destroying the netns.

Then, remove_proc_entry() will be called for non-existing proc
directory and trigger the warning below.

Let's handle the error of rpc_proc_register() properly in nfs_net_init().

firewire: ohci: mask bus reset interrupts between ISR and bottom half

In the FireWire OHCI interrupt handler, if a bus reset interrupt has
occurred, mask bus reset interrupts until bus_reset_work has serviced and
cleared the interrupt.

Normally, we always leave bus reset interrupts masked. We infer the bus
reset from the self-ID interrupt that happens shortly thereafter. A
scenario where we unmask bus reset interrupts was introduced in 2008 in
a007bb857e0b26f5d8b73c2ff90782d9c0972620: If
OHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS (8) is set in the debug parameter bitmask, we
will unmask bus reset interrupts so we can log them.

irq_handler logs the bus reset interrupt. However, we can't clear the bus
reset event flag in irq_handler, because we won't service the event until
later. irq_handler exits with the event flag still set. If the
corresponding interrupt is still unmasked, the first bus reset will
usually freeze the system due to irq_handler being called again each
time it exits. This freeze can be reproduced by loading firewire_ohci
with ""modprobe firewire_ohci debug=-1"" (to enable all debugging output).
Apparently there are also some cases where bus_reset_work will get called
soon enough to clear the event, and operation will continue normally.

This freeze was first reported a few months after a007bb85 was committed,
but until now it was never fixed. The debug level could safely be set
to -1 through sysfs after the module was loaded, but this would be
ineffectual in logging bus reset interrupts since they were only
unmasked during initialization.

irq_handler will now leave the event flag set but mask bus reset
interrupts, so irq_handler won't be called again and there will be no
freeze. If OHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS is enabled, bus_reset_work will
unmask the interrupt after servicing the event, so future interrupts
will be caught as desired.

As a side effect to this change, OHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS can now be
enabled through sysfs in addition to during initial module loading.
However, when enabled through sysfs, logging of bus reset interrupts will
be effective only starting with the second bus reset, after
bus_reset_work has executed.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/31279bbca40d2f40cb3bbb6d538ec9620a645dec"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4f9cc355c328fc4f41cbd9c4cd58b235184fa420"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5982887de60c1b84f9c0ca07c835814d07fd1da0"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6fafe3661712b143d9c69a7322294bd53f559d5d"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/752e3c53de0fa3b7d817a83050b6699b8e9c6ec9"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8643332aac0576581cfdf01798ea3e4e0d624b61"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b3948c69d60279fce5b2eeda92a07d66296c8130"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fa273f312334246c909475c5868e6daab889cc8c"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

scsi: lpfc: Move NPIV's transport unregistration to after resource clean up

There are cases after NPIV deletion where the fabric switch still believes
the NPIV is logged into the fabric.  This occurs when a vport is
unregistered before the Remove All DA_ID CT and LOGO ELS are sent to the
fabric.

Currently fc_remove_host(), which calls dev_loss_tmo for all D_IDs including
the fabric D_ID, removes the last ndlp reference and frees the ndlp rport
object.  This sometimes causes the race condition where the final DA_ID and
LOGO are skipped from being sent to the fabric switch.

Fix by moving the fc_remove_host() and scsi_remove_host() calls after DA_ID
and LOGO are sent.","0.00","","0.00","","[]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0936809d968ecf81e0726fbd02ff2a5732d960c3"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4ddf01f2f1504fa08b766e8cfeec558e9f8eef6c"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/718602cd15f4c5710850090ea3066a89eeb46278"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/76337eb8daee32bcc67742efab3168ed4ca299d0"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}, {""url"": ""https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f2c7f029051edc4b394bb48edbe2297575abefe0"", ""source"": ""416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67""}]",False

During internal penetration testing of a product based on Yii2, users discovered a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the framework itself. This issue is relevant for the latest version of Yii2 (2.0.49.3). This issue lies in the mechanism for displaying function argument values in the stack trace. The vulnerability manifests when an argument's value exceeds 32 characters. For convenience, argument values exceeding this limit are truncated and displayed with an added ""..."". The full argument value becomes visible when hovering over it with the mouse, as it is displayed in the title attribute of a span tag. However, the use of a double quote ("") allows an attacker to break out of the title attribute's value context and inject their own attributes into the span tag, including malicious JavaScript code through event handlers such as onmousemove. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the security context of the victim's site via a specially crafted link. This could lead to the theft of cookies (including httpOnly cookies, which are accessible on the page), content substitution, or complete takeover of user accounts.

The Fides webserver has a number of endpoints that retrieve `ConnectionConfiguration` records and their associated `secrets` which _can_ contain sensitive data (e.g. passwords, private keys, etc.). These `secrets` are stored encrypted at rest (in the application database), and the associated endpoints are not meant to expose that sensitive data in plaintext to API clients, as it could be compromising. Fides's developers have available to them a Pydantic field-attribute (`sensitive`) that they can annotate as `True` to indicate that a given secret field should not be exposed via the API. The application has an internal function that uses `sensitive` annotations to mask the sensitive fields with a `""**********""` placeholder value. This vulnerability is due to a bug in that function, which prevented `sensitive` API model fields that were _nested_ below the root-level of a `secrets` object from being masked appropriately. Only the `BigQuery` connection configuration secrets meets these criteria: the secrets schema has a nested sensitive `keyfile_creds.private_key` property that is exposed in plaintext via the APIs. Connection types other than `BigQuery` with sensitive fields at the root-level that are not nested are properly masked with the placeholder and are not affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been patched in Fides version 2.37.0. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. Users are also advised to rotate any Google Cloud secrets used for BigQuery integrations in their Fides deployments. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","6.50","CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","0.00","","[{""source"": ""security-advisories@github.com"", ""type"": ""Secondary"", ""description"": [{""lang"": ""en"", ""value"": ""CWE-200""}, {""lang"": ""en"", ""value"": ""CWE-201""}]}]","[]","[{""url"": ""https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/key-rotation"", ""source"": ""security-advisories@github.com""}, {""url"": ""https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-rcvg-jj3g-rj7c"", ""source"": ""security-advisories@github.com""}]",False

Sentry's Slack integration incorrectly records the incoming request body in logs. This request data can contain sensitive information, including the deprecated Slack verification token. With this verification token, it is possible under specific configurations, an attacker can forge requests and act as the Slack integration. The request body is leaked in log entries matching `event == ""slack.*"" && name == ""sentry.integrations.slack"" && request_data == *`. The deprecated slack verification token, will be found in the `request_data.token` key. **SaaS users** do not need to take any action. **Self-hosted users** should upgrade to version 24.5.0 or higher, rotate their Slack verification token, and use the Slack Signing Secret instead of the verification token. For users only using the `slack.signing-secret` in their self-hosted configuration, the legacy verification token is not used to verify the webhook payload. It is ignored. Users unable to upgrade should either set the `slack.signing-secret` instead of `slack.verification-token`. The signing secret is Slack's recommended way of authenticating webhooks. By having `slack.singing-secret` set, Sentry self-hosted will no longer use the verification token for authentication of the webhooks, regardless of whether `slack.verification-token` is set or not. Alternatively if the self-hosted instance is unable to be upgraded or re-configured to use the `slack.signing-secret`, the logging configuration can be adjusted to not generate logs from the integration. The default logging configuration can be found in `src/sentry/conf/server.py`. **Services should be restarted once the configuration change is saved.**
